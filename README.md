# 3D Sonic Post Processing

Scripts to process high-frequency 3D sonic wind and temperature measurements into wind statistics, turbulent fluxes and derived quantities.

## Application

Run the main script `process_sonic_55m_110m_sample`, which calls the other functions. You need to have the OneDAS connector, otherwise change the _filename_ path.
