# 3D Sonic Post Processing

Scripts to process high-frequency 3D sonic wind and temperature measurements into wind statistics, turbulent fluxes and derived quantities.

## Application

Run the script `process_sonic_55m_110m_sample` to post-process the Gill sonics (at 55m and 110m), which calls the other functions. You need to have the OneDAS connector, otherwise change the _filename_ path.

Run the script `process_sonic_15m_v1` to post-process the 25-m Thies sonic, which calls the other functions. You need to have the OneDAS connector, otherwise change the _filename_ path.
